## :snowboarder: Me
Hi, I'm James - a graduate full-stack developer at **IBM**. I love sports, movies, colour and solving problems.

I'm using what spare time I do have to learn and improve through small open-source projects. My eventual aim is to contribute towards the world's most impactful problems, possibly through more decentralised solutions.

## :pushpin: Current Projects
  - [ ] IBM Enterprise Software
