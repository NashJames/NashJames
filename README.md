## :snowboarder: Me
Hi, I'm James - a graduate full-stack developer at **IBM**. I love sports, movies and solving things.

I'm using what spare time I do have to learn and improve through small open-source projects. My eventual aim is to contribute towards the world's most impactful problems, through my work or personal projects.
