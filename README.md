## :snowboarder: Me
Hi, I'm James - a graduate full-stack developer at **IBM**. I love sports, movies, colour and problem solving.

I plan to use the time I do have to learn and create various open-source projects. We can work to decentralise solutions to the world's greatest problems.

## :pushpin: Current Projects
  - [ ] IBM Enterprise Software
